Pack is a low-level library for developing web applications in Python.  It
is meant to improve on WSGI by providing a clean, developer-friendly API.
Heavily inspired by Clojure's Ring and Ruby's Rack.

Pack apps are easily converted to WSGI apps.  WSGI middleware can also be
converted to Pack middleware.

EXAMPLE.

    # test.py

    import pack

    def app(req):
      return {"status": 200, "headers": {"content_type": "text/plain"},
              "body": "Hello, world!"}

    pack.adapters.serve_with_paste(app, {"port": 3000})

(Green Unicorn <http://gunicorn.org> is a good WSGI server.)

DESCRIPTION.

-- A Pack app is a function that takes a Pack request and returns a Pack
response.

-- A Pack request is a dict with the following keys.

  -- server_port
       Corresponds to SERVER_PORT in WSGI's environ.
  -- server_name
       Corresponds to SERVER_NAME in WSGI's environ.
  -- remote_addr
       Corresponds to REMOTE_ADDR in WSGI's environ (not required by specs).
  -- uri
       Corresponds to RAW_URI in WSGI's environ, or PATH_INFO if it is not
       given.
  -- query_string
       The portion of the request URL that follows the "?".  Corresponds to
       QUERY_STRING in WSGI's environ.
  -- scheme
       "http" or "https".  Corresponds to wsgi.url_scheme in WSGI's environ.
  -- method
       "GET", "POST", etc.  Corresponds to REQUEST_METHOD in WSGI's environ.
  -- headers
       A dict containing the request headers.  Each key-value pair corresponds
       to a key in WSGI's environ starting with "HTTP_".  If there are multiple
       headers for a single key, headers[key] will be the list of values.
  -- content_type
       Corresponds to CONTENT_TYPE in WSGI's environ.
  -- content_length
       Corresponds to CONTENT_LENGTH in WSGI's environ.
  -- body
       The HTTP request body as a stream.  Corresponds to wsgi.input in WSGI's
       environ.

-- A Pack response is a dict with the following keys.

  -- status
       An integer, e.g. 200, 404.
  -- headers
       A dict containing the response headers, e.g.
         {'content_type': 'text/html'}.
  -- body
       A string containing the body of the response.
